                  A Profile for Binding Messages (BMs)
                   draft-xu-fc-binding-message-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for Binding Messages (BM)
   used in Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A BM is a
   digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an IP
   address prefix announced from AS a to AS b and selected by AS b.
   When validated, a BM's eContent can be used for the detection and
   mitigation of route hijacking and provide protection for the AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] was designed with no
   mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes.  There are two
   types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks
   [RFC7908], plagues Internet security.

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security (See [RFC6480] for more information).
   As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow a BGP router
   to select and verify that a prefix is announced from and followed the
   path that it said itself.  And the router could also filter traffic
   according to this policy in the data plane.  A Binding Message
   provides this function.

   Binding Message (BM) is a signed object that binds the IP prefix with
   its announced AS's Paths, eventually, it could compose, verify, and
   protect the forwarding path of traffic.  It should together use with
   Forwarding Commitments [FC] which is a signed object used in the
   control plane to protect BGP routing.  BM is used for concatenating
   all ASes on the announced path.  It means that FC should provide the
   relationship between one IP prefix in a BGP-UPDATE message and the
   original announced AS, while BM should list all the generated FCs for
   one IP prefix in a BGP-UPDATE message.  The generated Binding Message
   is split into two parts, one for the BM body which is a newly signed
   object, and the other for the FCList which includes the BMID as well
   as a series of FCID [FC].  The FCList would be sent to all ASes in
   the reverse direction of related IP prefix propagation.

   The BM uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488]
   for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   wrapper for the BM content as well as a generic validation procedure
   for RPKI signed objects.  As BM needs to be validated with RPKI
   certificates issued by the current infrastructure, we assume the
   mandatory-to-implement algorithms in [RFC6485] or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the BM (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]),
   this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the BM signed object.
       This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the BM content, which is the payload signed
       by the BGP speaker.  The BM content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate a BM beyond the validation steps
       specified in [RFC6488].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The BM Content-Type

   The content-type for a BM is defined as BindingMessage and has the
   numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.(TBD).

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The BM eContent

   The content of a BM identifies a binding message and forwarding
   binding that an AS has selected one AS path to announce to other
   nodes upon receiving a BGP-UPDATE message.  Other ASes that are on-
   path can validate the BM and perform path verification for traffic
   forwarding based on the AS-path information.  Off-path ASes can
   utilize this BM for collaborative filtering. a BM is an instance of
   BindingMessageAttestation, formally defined by the following ASN.1
   [X.680] module:

   RPKI-BM-2023
     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-rpki-BM-2023(TBD) }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=
   BEGIN

   IMPORTS
     CONTENT-TYPE
     FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010 -- RFC 6268
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) } ;

       prefixD             SEQUENCE (SIZE(1)) OF Prefix,

       prefixLength        INTEGER (SIZE(0..128))}

   AFI ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(2))

   IPAddress ::= BIT STRING (SIZE(0..128))

   BindingMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
       id                  BIT STRING
       signature           BIT STRING }

   END

                   Figure 1: eContent of BM signed object

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo (see [RFC6488]).

3.1.  version

   The version number of the BindingMessageAttestation MUST be 0.

3.2.  asidS

   The asidS field contains the AS number of the AS that generates the
   BM signed object.

3.3.  Type Prefix

   Within the Prefix structure, the prefix field encodes the set of IP
   address prefixes.

3.3.1.  Element afi

   Within the Prefix structure, afi contains the Address Family
   Identifier of an IP address family.  This specification only supports
   IPv4 and IPv6.  Therefore, afi MUST be either 0001 or 0002.

3.3.2.  Element address

   The address field contains the IP address.

3.3.3.  Element prefixLength

   The prefixLength field contains the length of the IP address prefix.

3.4.  prefixS

   This field is a set of IP prefixes that belongs to the BM generating
   AS according to its local routing policy.  Thus, these IP prefixes
   are the BM generating AS would like to use when it communicates with
   the prefix in the BGP-UPDATE message.

3.5.  prefixD

   This field is only one IP prefix that contains in the BGP-UPDATE
   message and binds an FC signed object.

3.6.  Type BindingMessage

   Within the BindingMessage structure, the bm field encodes the binding
   message generated by this current AS and will be validated by other
   AS.

3.6.1.  Element id

   The id field contains the hash of the previous AS-path in the
   associated BGP-UPDATE plus the self AS number and above prefixD
   filed.

3.6.2.  Element signature

   The signature field is a signature signed by the BGP speaker who
   issues this BM.  This field should also sign the contents of FCList
   which would not be synchronized by RPKI.

4.  BM Validation

   Before a relying party can sign a new BM to announce it has trusted
   and selected the forwarding path, the relying party MUST first
   validate the BM signed object itself.  To validate a BM, the relying
   party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in [RFC6488]
   as well as the following additional BM-specific validation step.

   The IP Address Delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the end-
   entity (EE) certificate (contained within the BM), and the IP address
   prefix (just only prefixS) in the BM payload is contained within the
   set of IP addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP Address
   Delegation extension.  The EE certificate's IP Address Delegation
   extension MUST NOT contain "inherit" elements described in [RFC3779].
   The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension described in
   [RFC3779] is also used in Binding Message and MUST be present in the
   EE certificate.

5.  BM-based BGP Path Verification

5.1.  FCList Generation

   FCList contains a BMID as well as a set of FCIDs that relate to a
   Binding Message.  FCList has a one-to-one relationship with BM.  That
   means the BGP router generates BM and FCList as a pair, but they
   would not all be placed at RPKI.

   As it is private data that consist of the AS_PATH information, FCList
   would not be synchronized through RPKI.  Otherwise, adversarial ASes
   may lunch an attack and get the path information.

   It SHOULD use TCP and Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other end-to-
   end communication techniques to send the FCList to on-path ASes in an
   off-pathway.  And these ASes MUST store receiving FCLists until RPKI
   is synchronized and relative BM is verified.

   The process of FCList is TBD.

   The generation time of FCList is the same as the BM generation time.

   By FCList, we also could get a path-aware network.

5.2.  BM Generation

   When one AS establishes a connection with its peer, it announces its
   route to this peer.  When one BGP router receives one BGP-UPDATE
   message, it would generate the FC and BM signed object for each IP
   prefix in the BGP-UPDATE message.  The generation time of BM is the
   same as FC, they are both generated after the process of BGP path
   selection.

   The process of FC generation is in [FC] from which one can get more
   information.

   The process of the generator of BM SHOULD be split into two parts,

   *  generation of BM which is the signed object,

   *  and generation of FCList which contains a BMID and a set of FCIDs.

   Taking the following topology as an example, there are 4 ASes and the
   topology of them is in a line as Figure 2 shows.

   +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
   | AS 65536 | --- | AS 65537 | --- | AS 65538 | --- | AS 65539 |
   +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+

                    Figure 2: A topology example of 3 AS

   Suppose that the simplified RIB table of AS 65536 is as follows.
   That means there is 1 BGP-UPDATE that is announced from AS 65539 to
   AS 65538, 1 BGP-UPDATE that is announced from AS 65538 to AS 65537,
   and 1 BGP-UPDATE that is announced from AS 65537 to AS 65536.

   Network           Next Hop        Path
   2001:db8:a::/48   ::              i
   2001:db8:b::/48   2001:db8:a::1   65537 i
   2001:db8:c::/48   2001:db8:a::1   65537 65538 i
   2001:db8:d::/48   2001:db8:a::1   65537 65538 65539 i

                 Figure 3: Simplified RIB table of AS 65536

   Let's take the announcement of the prefix 2001:db8:d::/48 as an
   example.

   First, the BGP router of AS 65539 generates one FC FC_{65539, 65538}
   when it announces the prefix to AS 65538.

   Then, the BGP router in AS 65538 would generate one FC FC_{65539,
   65538, 65537}, one BM, and one FCList after receiving the BGP-UPDATE
   message.  The newly generated FC and BM would be placed at the RPKI
   repository, but the FCList which contains the ASID of AS 65538 and
   the FCID of the FC, i.e. {BMID1, {FC_{65539, 65538}_id}}, would be
   sent to the ASes on the BGP-UPDATE propagation path, which means the
   FCList would be sent to AS 65539.  And the BGP-UPDATE would also
   announce to AS 65537.  For BM generated by the BGP router of AS
   65538, it fills the eContent of BM signed object as follows:

   BM_{65538, 65539}:
     version: 0
     asidS: 65538
     prefixS:
       afi: 2,
       address: 2001:db8:c::
       prefixLength: 48
     prefixD:
       afi: 2
       address: 2001:db8:d::
       prefixLength: 48
     BindingMessage:
       id: HASH({65539}, 65538, 2001:db8:d::/48) -- as BMID1
       signature: SIGNATURE1

   Next, the BGP router in AS 65537 would generate one FC FC_{65539,
   65538, 65537, 65536}, one BM, and one FCList after receiving the BGP-
   UPDATE message.  The newly generated FC and BM would be placed at the
   RPKI repository, but the FCList which contains the ASID of AS 65537
   and the FCIDs of the two FCs, i.e. {BMID2, {FC_{65539, 65538}_id,
   FC_{65539, 65538, 65537}_id}, would be sent to the ASes on the BGP-
   UPDATE propagation path, which means the FCList would be sent to AS
   65538 and AS 65539 independently.  And the BGP-UPDATE would also
   announce to AS 65536.  For BM generated by the BGP router of AS
   65537, it fills the eContent of BM signed object as follows:

   BM_{65537, 65538, 65539}:
     version: 0
     asidS: 65537
     prefixS:
       afi: 2,
       address: 2001:db8:b::
       prefixLength: 48
     prefixD:
       afi: 2
       address: 2001:db8:d::
       prefixLength: 48
     BindingMessage:
       id: HASH({65539, 65538}, 65537, 2001:db8:d::/48) -- as BMID2
       signature: SIGNATURE2

   Finally, the BGP router in AS 65536 would generate one BM and one
   FCList after receiving the BGP-UPDATE message.  The newly generated
   BM would be placed at the RPKI repository, but the FCList which
   contains the ASID of AS 65536 and the FCIDs of the three FCs, i.e.
   {BMID3, {FC_{65539, 65538}_id, FC_{65539, 65538, 65537}_id,
   FC_{65539, 65538, 65537, 65536}_id}, would be sent to the ASes on the
   BGP-UPDATE propagation path, which means the FCList would be sent to
   AS 65537, AS 65538, and AS 65539.  For BM generated by the BGP router
   of AS 65537, it fills the eContent of BM signed object as follows:

 BM_{65536, 65537, 65538, 65539}:
   version: 0
   asidS: 65536
   prefixS:
     afi: 2,
     address: 2001:db8:a::
     prefixLength: 48
   prefixD:
     afi: 2
     address: 2001:db8:d::
     prefixLength: 48
   BindingMessage:
     id: HASH({65539, 65538, 65537}, 65536, 2001:db8:d::/48) -- as BMID3
     signature: SIGNATURE3

5.3.  Filtering Rules Generation

   When one AS receives one BGP-UPDATE, it MUST do as usual: filter the
   BGP route using its local policy, scratch the BGP route to its Route
   Information Base (RIB) table, generate Forwarding Information Base
   (FIB) table, and send it out as per the routing policy.

   When the BM and FC signed objects synchronize from the RPKI
   repository, the BGP speaker MUST first verify FCs.  According to the
   verified FCs, the router then could verify the BMs.  It SHOULD find
   FCList by the id field of one BM.  Then it gets all the FCIDs in the
   FCList.  Based on previous verified FCs, it could know which prefix
   is received as it announces.

   It RECOMMENDs deleting all the invalid RIB items to instruct the
   traffic forwarding.  If all the FCs and BMs are valid, the forwarding
   plane would be a valid one, and source validation and path
   verification are complete.
