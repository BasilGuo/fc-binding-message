                  A Profile for Binding Messages (BMs)
                   draft-xu-fc-binding-message-latest

Abstract

   This documents defines a standard profile for Binding Messages (BM)
   used in Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A BM is a
   digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an IP
   address prefix announced from AS a to AS b and selected by AS b.
   When validated, a BM's eContent can be used for detection and
   mitigation of route hijacking and provide protection for the AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] was designed with no
   mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes.  There are two
   types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks
   [RFC7908], plagues Internet security.

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security (See [RFC6480] for more information).
   As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow a BGP router
   to select and verify that a prefix is announced from and followed the
   path that it said itself.  And the router could also filter traffic
   according to this policy in the data plane.  A Binding Message
   provides this function.

   Binding Message (BM) is a signed object that binds the IP prefix with
   its announced AS's Paths, eventually, it could compose, verify, and
   protect the forwarding path of traffic.  It should together use with
   Forwarding Commitments [FC] which is a signed object used in the
   control plane to protect BGP routing.  BM is used for concatenating
   all ASes on the announced path.  It means that FC should provide the
   relationship between one IP prefix in a BGP-UPDATE message and the
   original announced AS, while BM should list all the generated FCs for
   one IP prefix in a BGP-UPDATE message.  The generated Binding Message
   is split into two parts, one for the BM body which is a newly signed
   object, and the other for the FCList which includes the ASID of
   current AS as well as a series of FCID [FC].  The FCList would be
   sent to all ASes in the reverse direction of related IP prefix
   propagation.

   The BM uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488]
   for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   wrapper for the BM content as well as a generic validation procedure
   for RPKI signed objects.  As BM needs to be validated with RPKI
   certificates issued by the current infrastructure, we assume the
   mandatory-to-implement algorithms in [RFC6485], or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the FC (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]),
   this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the FC signed object.
       This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the BM content, which is the payload signed
       by the BGP speaker.  The FC content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate a BM beyond the validation steps
       specified in [RFC6488].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The BM Content-Type

   The content-type for a BM is defined as BindingMessage and has the
   numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.(TBD).

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The BM eContent

   The content of a BM identifies a binding message and forwarding
   binding that an AS has selected one AS path to announce to other
   nodes upon receiving a BGP-UPDATE message.  Other ASes that are on-
   path can validate the BM and perform path verification for traffic
   forwarding based on the AS-path information.  Off-path ASes can
   utilize this BM for collaborative filtering. a BM is an instance of
   BindingMessageAttestation, formally defined by the following ASN.1
   [X.680] module:

   RPKI-BM-2023
     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-rpki-BM-2023(TBD) }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=
   BEGIN

   IMPORTS

     FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010 -- RFC 6268
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) } ;

   id-ct-BM OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
       rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) id-smime(16) id-ct(1) bm(TDB) }

   ct-BM CONTENT-TYPE ::=

   ForwardingCommitmentAttestation ::= SEQUENCE {

       version
       asidS               ASID,
       prefixS             SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF Prefix,
       prefixD             SEQUENCE (SIZE(1)) OF Prefix,
       bm                  BindingMessage
   }

   ASID ::= INTEGER (0..4294967295)

   Prefix ::= SEQUENCE {
       afi                 AFI,
       address             IPAddress,
       prefixLength        INTEGER (SIZE(0..128))}

   AFI ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(2))

   IPAddress ::= BIT STRING (SIZE(0..128))

   BindingMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
       signature           BIT STRING }

   END

                   Figure 1: eContent of BM signed object

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo (see [RFC6488]).

3.1.  version

   The version number of the BindingMessageAttestation MUST be 0.

3.2.  asidS

   The asidS field contains the AS number of the AS that generates the
   BM signed object.

3.3.  Type Prefix

   Within the Prefix structure, the prefix field encodes the set of IP
   address prefixes.

3.3.1.  Element afi

   Within the Prefix structure, afi contains the Address Family
   Identifier of an IP address family.  This specification only supports
   IPv4 and IPv6.  Therefore, afi MUST be either 0001 or 0002.

3.3.2.  Element address

   The address field contains the IP address.

3.3.3.  Element prefixLength

   The prefixLength field contains the length of the IP address prefix.

3.4.  prefixS

   This field is a set of IP prefixes that belongs to the BM gnerating
   AS according to its local routing policy.  Thus, these IP prefixes
   are the BM generating AS would like to use when it communicates with
   the prefix in BGP-UPDATE message.

3.5.  prefixD

   This field is only one IP prefix that contains in BGP-UPDATE message
   and binds an FC signed object.

3.6.  Type BindingMessage

   Within the BindingMessage structure, the bm field encodes the binding
   message generated by this current AS and will be validated by other
   AS.

3.6.1.  Element signature

   The signature field is a signature signed by the BGP speaker who
   issues this BM.

4.  BM Validation

5.  BM based BGP Path Verification

5.1.  BM Generation

   When one BGP router recives one BGP-UPDATE message, it would generate
   the FC and BM signed object.  The process of FC generation is in [FC]
   that one can get more information.  The process of generator of BM
   SHOULD be split into two part,

   *  generation of BM body.

   *  and generation of BM message.

   The generation time of BM is the same as FC, they are both generated
   after the process of BGP path selection.

7.  IANA Considerations
