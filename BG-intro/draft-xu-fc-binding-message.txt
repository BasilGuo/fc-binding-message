                  A Profile for Binding Messages (BMs)
                   draft-xu-fc-binding-message-latest

Abstract

   This documents defines a standard profile for Binding Messages (BM)
   used in Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A BM is a
   digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an IP
   address prefix announced from AS a to AS b and selected by AS b.
   When validated, a BM's eContent can be used for detection and
   mitigation of route hijacking and provide protection for the AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] was designed with no
   mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes.  There are two
   types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks
   [RFC7908], plagues Internet security.

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security (See [RFC6480] for more information).
   As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow a BGP router
   to select and verify that a prefix is announced from and followed the
   path that it said itself.  And the router could also filter traffic
   according to this policy in the data plane.  A Binding Message
   provides this function.

   Binding Message (BM) is a signed object that binds the IP prefix with
   its announced AS's Paths, eventually, it could compose, verify, and
   protect the forwarding path of traffic.  It should together use with
   Forwarding Commitments [FC] which is a signed object used in the
   control plane to protect BGP routing.  BM is used for concatenating
   all ASes on the announced path.  It means that FC should provide the
   relationship between one IP prefix in a BGP-UPDATE message and the
   original announced AS, while BM should list all the generated FCs for
   one IP prefix in a BGP-UPDATE message.  The generated Binding Message
   is split into two parts, one for the BM body (BM-body) which is a
   newly signed object, and the other for the BM message (BM-msg) which
   would be sent to all ASes in the reverse direction of related IP
   prefix propagation.

   The BM-body uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects
   [RFC6488] for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   [RFC5652] wrapper for the BM-body content as well as a generic
   validation procedure for RPKI signed objects.  As BM-body needs to be
   validated with RPKI certificates issued by the current
   infrastructure, we assume the mandatory-to-implement algorithms in
   [RFC6485], or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the FC (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]),
   this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the FC signed object.
       This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the BM-body content, which is the payload
       signed by the BGP speaker.  The FC content is encoded using the
       ASN.1 [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate a BM-body beyond the validation
       steps specified in [RFC6488].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  BM based BGP Path Verification

3.1.  BM Generation

   When one BGP router recives one BGP-UPDATE message, it would generate
   the FC and BM signed object.  The process of FC generation is in [FC]
   that one can get more information.  The process of generator of BM
   SHOULD be split into two part,

   *  generation of BM body.

   *  and generation of BM message.

   The generation time of BM is the same as FC, they are both generated
   after the process of BGP path selection.

5.  IANA Considerations
